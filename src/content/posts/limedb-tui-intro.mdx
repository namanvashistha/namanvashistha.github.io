We're excited to announce the release of a new Text User Interface (TUI) for LimeDB! This commit introduces a dedicated `tui/` directory with a robust, developer-friendly terminal application designed to simplify interaction and monitoring of your LimeDB clusters.

LimeDB is a lightweight, fast, open-source distributed key-value store built for high-performance systems. Managing and observing distributed systems can be complex, and this TUI aims to provide a clear, real-time overview directly from your terminal.

## Key Features of the LimeDB TUI

### Cluster Status Overview

Get an immediate snapshot of all your LimeDB nodes. See which nodes are active, their ports, node IDs, and peer counts. Errors for inaccessible nodes are clearly displayed.

### Ring Distribution Visualization

Understand how data partitions are distributed across your cluster. The TUI visualizes the ring state, showing token shares and range counts for each node, helping you assess balance and ownership.

### Data Explorer

Interact directly with your key-value store. You can easily perform `GET`, `SET`, and `DELETE` operations on keys, making it convenient for debugging or quick data checks without needing to use raw API calls.

### Built with Textual

The TUI leverages the [Textual](https://textual.io/) framework for rich terminal graphics and interactivity, providing a modern and responsive experience. It uses `aiohttp` for asynchronous communication with LimeDB's API.

## Running the TUI

To run the TUI:

1. Ensure you have `uv` installed (`pip install uv`)
2. Navigate to the `tui` directory
3. Run `uv run main.py`

## Why This Matters

This TUI is a significant step towards improving the developer experience for LimeDB users, making it easier to deploy, monitor, and debug your distributed key-value store. Rather than making multiple API calls or parsing JSON responses, you can now visualize your cluster's state and interact with data through an intuitive interface.

We believe this TUI will be an invaluable tool for anyone working with LimeDB.
