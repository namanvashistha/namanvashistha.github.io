We've updated the `README.md` for LimeDB to include an important migration notice.

LimeDB, our lightweight, fast, open-source distributed key-value store, is beginning its transition from a Java-based implementation to Go. This strategic shift is driven by several key advantages Go offers, including:

## Why Go?

### Improved Performance

Go's concurrency model and efficient compilation can lead to faster execution. The language's built-in goroutines and channels make it particularly well-suited for building high-performance distributed systems like LimeDB.

### Lower Memory Footprint

Go applications generally consume less memory, making LimeDB even more resource-efficient. This is particularly important for deployments where minimizing infrastructure costs is a priority.

### Simpler Deployment

Go's static linking creates single, self-contained binaries, simplifying deployment and operations. No more wrestling with JVM versions, classpaths, or complex dependency management—just ship a single binary.

## Smooth Transition

We understand the importance of a smooth transition. The new Go implementation is being developed to maintain API compatibility with the current Java version. For existing users, the Java implementation will continue to be fully functional and will receive maintenance updates throughout this transition period.

## What This Means for You

If you're currently using LimeDB:

- **No immediate action required**: The Java version continues to work as expected
- **API compatibility**: The Go version will maintain the same API surface
- **Gradual migration**: You can transition at your own pace
- **Continued support**: Both versions will be maintained during the transition

## Looking Forward

This move reinforces our commitment to delivering a high-performance, robust distributed key-value store. The Go implementation will bring significant improvements in:

- Deployment simplicity with single-binary distribution
- Resource efficiency with lower memory usage
- Performance gains from Go's concurrency model
- Easier contribution for the growing Go community
