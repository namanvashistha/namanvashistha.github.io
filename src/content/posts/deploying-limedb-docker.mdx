We've just merged an important commit to the LimeDB repository, significantly enhancing the deployment experience for developers and operators. The `README.md` now includes a dedicated section detailing Docker deployment instructions and container specifications.

## What is LimeDB?

For those new to it, LimeDB is a lightweight, fast, open-source distributed key-value store designed for high-performance systems. Its goal is to provide a robust and efficient storage solution that's easy to integrate and scale.

## What's New in the README?

This update introduces a comprehensive guide to deploying LimeDB using Docker, covering both development and production scenarios. Here's a breakdown of what you'll find:

### Container Specifications

The new documentation outlines the characteristics of the official LimeDB Docker images:

- **Base Image**: Built on Amazon Corretto 21 Alpine for robust Java performance
- **Size**: Optimized to 384MB, which is 47% smaller than standard images, reducing download times and disk usage
- **Memory**: Configurable heap memory from 256MB to 1GB, allowing fine-tuning for different workloads
- **Security**: Runs as a non-root user with a minimal attack surface
- **Signals**: Proper signal handling is ensured with `dumb-init`

### Development Setup

Learn how to quickly get a LimeDB instance running for local development:

- Instructions for building an optimized Docker image locally
- Commands to start a single LimeDB node, demonstrating how to connect it to an external PostgreSQL database using environment variables like `NODE_ID`, `DB_HOST`, `DB_USERNAME`, and `DB_PASSWORD`

### Production Cluster Deployment

For more robust setups, the guide includes:

- Examples for deploying a full LimeDB cluster with PostgreSQL using `docker-compose -f docker-compose.prod.yml up -d`
- How to override default configurations, such as database passwords and JVM memory settings (`JVM_MEMORY_OPTS`), directly via environment variables when launching the cluster

### Environment Variables

A detailed table explains all configurable environment variables, including:

- `NODE_ID` - Unique identifier for the node
- Database connection details: `DB_HOST`, `DB_PORT`, `DB_USERNAME`, `DB_PASSWORD`
- JVM tuning options: `JVM_MEMORY_OPTS`, `JAVA_OPTS`

### Health Checks

Ensure your LimeDB containers and applications are running smoothly with the provided health check commands:

- `docker ps` - Check container status
- `curl http://localhost:7001/actuator/health` - Application health status
- `curl http://localhost:7001/cluster/state | jq` - Cluster metrics and state

## Why This Matters

This update is crucial for several reasons:

- **Simplified Deployment**: It drastically lowers the barrier to entry for running LimeDB, whether for evaluation, development, or production
- **Consistency**: Provides a standardized, reproducible way to deploy LimeDB across different environments
- **Operational Efficiency**: The optimized container specifications and clear instructions help reduce operational overhead and improve resource utilization
- **Best Practices**: Encourages secure and efficient container deployment methodologies from the outset

We encourage everyone to explore the updated `README.md` and leverage these new Docker deployment capabilities to get LimeDB up and running faster than ever. Your feedback is always welcome!
