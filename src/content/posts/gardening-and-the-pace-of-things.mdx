I started gardening for a simple reason - I wanted to do something quiet. No screen. No electricity. No machines in the background. Just soil, water, and sunlight.

Most of my day runs on fast feedback. In software engineering, everything responds quickly. Code compiles or it doesn’t. Logs react instantly. A change either improves something or breaks it. Within seconds, there’s a signal.

I got used to that rhythm.

Act. Observe. Adjust. Repeat. There’s almost always some visible indication of progress or failure. Over time, I started expecting effort to produce movement quickly.

Gardening doesn’t operate on that rhythm.

I water a plant and nothing seems to change. The soil looks the same the next morning. The leaves don’t visibly grow. If something is happening, it’s happening underground.

I didn’t realize how uneasy that would make me.

I caught myself checking more often than necessary. Looking for signs of growth. Wanting confirmation that the effort was working. Without visible feedback, doubt appears easily.

Engineering trains me to shorten feedback loops. Make systems more responsive. Detect issues faster. Plants ignore that instinct. They grow at a pace that doesn’t adjust to my expectations.

I’ve noticed how dependent I’ve become on quick validation. When progress isn’t visible, I tend to question the process.

With gardening, I don’t question the seed just because I can’t see change yet. I keep watering it.

I’m still getting used to that pace.
