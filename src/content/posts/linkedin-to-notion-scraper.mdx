A Python-based job scraping system that pulls LinkedIn listings into a structured Notion database. Repository: [jobs-scrape-to-notion](https://github.com/namanvashistha/jobs-scrape-to-notion)

## Setup Steps

### 1. Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/namanvashistha/jobs-scrape-to-notion
cd jobs-scrape-to-notion
```

### 2. Install dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 3. Configure Notion

- Create a Notion integration at [notion.so/my-integrations](https://www.notion.so/my-integrations)
- Create a new Notion database
- Share your database with the integration
- Copy the database ID from its URL

### 4. Set environment variables

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

Update `.env` with your credentials:

```bash
NOTION_API_KEY=your_integration_token
NOTION_DATABASE_ID=your_database_id
```

## Key Features

### Job Scraping

```python
def fetch_jobs(search_terms, location, results_wanted=20):
    # Scrapes LinkedIn jobs based on multiple search terms
    # Returns a pandas DataFrame with job details
```

### Notion Integration

- Creates structured database entries
- Handles rich text, URLs, dates, and company logos
- Prevents duplicate entries
- Manages API rate limits

### Data Processing

- Sanitizes input data
- Formats salary ranges for Indian currency
- Handles company metadata
- Manages file attachments for logos

## Running the Scraper

```bash
python main.py
```

Default configuration:

- Search terms: ["Software Engineer", "Backend", "SDE"]
- Location: India
- Results per term: 20
- Platform: LinkedIn

## Customization

Modify `main()` in `scraper.py`:

```python
search_terms = ["Your", "Preferred", "Terms"]
location = "Your Location"
results_wanted = 30  # Number of results per term
```

## Error Handling

The system includes:

- Comprehensive logging
- Rate limit management
- Duplicate prevention
- Data validation

## Why This Matters

Job hunting can be overwhelming when you're tracking applications across multiple platforms. This tool helps you:

1. **Centralize Job Listings**: Keep all potential opportunities in one place
2. **Stay Organized**: Track application status, deadlines, and notes
3. **Save Time**: Automate the tedious process of copying job details
4. **Make Better Decisions**: Compare opportunities side-by-side in your Notion board

## Future Enhancements

Potential improvements for this project:

- Support for additional job platforms (Indeed, Glassdoor, etc.)
- Automatic application status tracking
- Email notifications for new matches
- Resume tailoring suggestions based on job descriptions
- Interview scheduling integration

Visit the [repository](https://github.com/namanvashistha/jobs-scrape-to-notion) for source code and detailed documentation.

This automation demonstrates how a few hundred lines of Python can save hours of manual work during your job search. The structured Notion database gives you a clear overview of all opportunities, making it easier to prioritize and track your applications.
