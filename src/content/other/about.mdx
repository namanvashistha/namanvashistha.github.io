Hey! I'm Naman, a Software Engineer based in India. I build scalable backend systems and have a deep fascination with distributed architectures.

Currently, I'm working on **LimeDB**, a distributed key-value store built from scratch in Go. The project started as a learning journey into distributed systems with features like consistent hashing, replication, and a web-based terminal UI for monitoring.

My expertise spans across **Python, Go, C/C++, JavaScript, and PHP**, with hands-on experience in payment systems, real-time applications, and DevOps automation. I've built things from chess engines using bitboard representations to custom programming languages.

I love diving deep into system internals, optimizing performance, and solving complex architectural problems. When I'm not coding, you'll find me writing about my learnings on [Dev.to](https://dev.to/namanvashistha), solving problems on LeetCode, or exploring new technologies to add to my toolkit.

I believe in learning by building — most of my projects are open source and available on [GitHub](https://github.com/namanvashistha). Feel free to check them out, and let's connect if you're interested in distributed systems, backend engineering, or just want to chat about tech!
