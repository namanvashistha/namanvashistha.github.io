I'm a Software Development Engineer - II with a passion for building scalable backend systems and high-impact products.

I specialize in payment systems, distributed architectures, and developer tooling. My expertise includes Python, Go, C/C++, JavaScript, and PHP, along with frameworks like Django, Flask, NodeJS, and Laravel.

When I'm not coding, I'm exploring new technologies and contributing to open-source projects!
