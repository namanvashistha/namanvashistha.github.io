A real-time multiplayer chess application that allows two players to play chess against each other. Built with Go, PostgreSQL, and Redis, featuring a bitboard chess engine for efficient move validation and game state management.

## Key Features

- **Real-time Gameplay**: WebSocket-based real-time communication between players
- **Bitboard Engine**: Efficient chess engine using bitboard representation for fast move validation
- **Game Invites**: Join games using unique invite codes
- **Redis Caching**: Fast game state retrieval and caching
- **PostgreSQL Storage**: Persistent game history and user data
- **Clean UI**: Responsive web interface for seamless gameplay

## Architecture

The application follows a clean architecture pattern with:
- **API Layer**: RESTful endpoints and WebSocket handlers
- **Service Layer**: Business logic for game management
- **Chess Engine**: Bitboard-based move generation and validation
- **Repository Layer**: Data persistence with PostgreSQL
- **Real-time**: WebSocket service for live game updates

## Tech Stack

- **Backend**: Go 1.21+
- **Database**: PostgreSQL for persistence
- **Cache**: Redis for fast state management
- **WebSockets**: Real-time bidirectional communication
- **Frontend**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript

## How It Works

1. Create a new game and receive an invite code
2. Share the code with an opponent
3. Opponent joins using the invite code
4. Play chess in real-time with move validation
5. Game state syncs instantly via WebSockets

The bitboard chess engine ensures valid moves while maintaining high performance, making the game responsive and enjoyable.
