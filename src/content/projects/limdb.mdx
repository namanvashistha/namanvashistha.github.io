LimeDB is a distributed key-value database built from scratch to understand distributed systems, database internals, and horizontal scaling. It implements a peer-to-peer architecture where any node can act as both coordinator and storage.

## Key Features

- **Peer-to-Peer Architecture**: No single point of failure - any node can handle requests
- **Consistent Hashing**: Hash ring with virtual nodes for optimal load distribution
- **REST API**: GET/SET/DELETE operations with automatic routing
- **PostgreSQL Storage**: Transitional storage engine with plans for custom LSM trees
- **Real-time Monitoring**: Terminal UI for cluster health visualization
- **Docker Support**: Ultra-lightweight containers (&lt;50MB) with multi-platform releases

## Architecture

LimeDB uses a peer-to-peer coordinator-shard pattern where clients can connect to any node. Each node:
- Handles requests locally if it owns the data
- Routes to the correct peer using consistent hashing
- Shares cluster state via gossip protocol

## Roadmap

**Phase 2 (In Progress)**: Consistent hashing, performance analysis, connection pool optimization

**Phase 3**: Production readiness with gossip protocol, health checks, dynamic rebalancing

**Phase 4**: Custom LSM tree storage engine replacing PostgreSQL

**Phase 5**: Advanced features including compression, caching, and cross-datacenter replication

## Tech Stack

- **Language**: Go 1.21+ with FastHTTP
- **Database**: PostgreSQL 14+ (transitional)
- **Routing**: MD5-based consistent hashing with virtual nodes
- **Communication**: HTTP REST for inter-node communication
- **Monitoring**: Textual TUI for real-time cluster status

This project represents a deep dive into distributed systems fundamentals - understanding CAP theorem, consensus protocols, and database internals through hands-on implementation.
